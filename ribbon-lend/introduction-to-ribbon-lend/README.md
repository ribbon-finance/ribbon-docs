# Introduction to Ribbon Lend

## What is Ribbon Lend?

Ribbon Lend is a DeFi marketplace for institutional [unsecured loans](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unsecuredloan.asp). Users can deposit their capital in single-borrower, insured pools, created and launched on Ribbon Lend by institutional borrowers (like Alameda, Folkvang, Wintermute, just to name a few) who have been whitelisted. Lenders can receive favorable risk-adjusted interest rates in exchange for providing liquidity, while whitelisted institutional borrowers can borrow money from a decentralized source without the need for collateral.

Ribbon Lend offers the best of both worlds between TradFi and DeFi:&#x20;

1. [Yields from unsecured lending](yields-from-unsecured-lending.md); you can decide independently how much and in which pools to deposit, based on your preferred risk/return profile.
2. [No lockups](no-lockups/) **** from Aave’s money market model; you can withdraw whenever you want, the overall amount of funds that can be withdrawn is determined solely by the utilization rate of the pool.
3. [Off-chain enforcement / credit underwriting](off-chain-enforcement-credit-underwriting.md);
4. [Built-in insurance](built-in-insurance.md).

All loans in our structured products, including Ribbon Earn and new vaults, will flow into Ribbon Lend pools. This allows us to leverage our Ribbon structured products as a reliable and sizable source of lending deposits in the credit facility.&#x20;

Furthermore, this allows our structured products to be redeemable on a weekly basis and potentially even on a block-by-block basis, attracting further TVL.
