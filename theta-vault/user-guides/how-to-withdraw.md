# How to withdraw

In this guide you will find instructions for making a vault withdrawal. If while following these instructions you encounter any difficulties or errors, we are at your disposal in our [Discord](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://discord.gg/rm7h9ce3ep\&sa=D\&source=editors\&ust=1662915623979136\&usg=AOvVaw1Swts\_wZ6Q7MHXJdVeTOWI) server Support channel.

Please keep in mind that in order to withdraw, your funds in the vault must NOT BE:

* Paused: if you need instructions to resume your position, you can follow [this guide](how-to-pause-and-resume.md);
* Staked: if you need instructions to unstake your position, you can follow [this guide](how-to-stake-unstake-vault-shares-and-claim-rewards.md).

There are two types of withdrawals, every detail of which you will find in this guide:

1. Instant: only applicable to funds that are deposited mid-week and have yet to be actively used in the vault or recently resumed positions;
2. Standard: a two-step process. At any point in time you can submit a withdrawal (or many) to the queue and then finalize it after the weekly rollover. A standard withdrawal is also the only form of withdrawal you can use for paused or deprecated vaults; in these cases, please reach out on Discord because action on our part is required.

An important note: It is not possible to make a vault switch; to move between vaults, you must first withdraw and then deposit again. This implies a minimum one-week pause between withdrawal and subsequent entry.

## Connect your wallet <a href="#h.hf5hlm9dkqrg" id="h.hf5hlm9dkqrg"></a>

Please refer to the first section of [this guide](how-to-deposit.md#connect-your-wallet) if you need help connecting your wallet.

## Instant withdrawal <a href="#h.ig30e2hrjp4j" id="h.ig30e2hrjp4j"></a>

An instant withdrawal is only possible if the funds you deposited have not yet been used by the vault: all funds deposited from 11am UTC on Friday until 8am UTC the following Friday can be withdrawn in this way.

It’s also the method for withdrawing funds that have just been resumed after being paused, again by Friday (for reference, please see [here](how-to-pause-and-resume.md)).

Select the vault in which you have invested; the withdrawal interface is immediately available in the vault card (desktop) or appears after selecting "INVEST" (mobile). If you do not yet own vault shares, the standard withdrawal will be automatically grayed out.

Once the onchain transaction has been confirmed, you’ll receive a notification in the upper right corner (desktop) or top section (mobile).

Please remember that vaults containing staked tokens will only return you staked tokens. So even in the case of instant withdrawal, stETH, rETH and sAVAX vaults will give you stETH, rETH and sAVAX.

## Standard withdrawal <a href="#h.stqn8ca118g" id="h.stqn8ca118g"></a>

The first step for a standard withdrawal is to initiate it. With this action, you will signal the vault to set aside your funds at the next rollover, on Friday after 8 am UTC. This implies that your funds will in any case be subject to the profits or losses of the week in which you decide to initiate a withdrawal.

Before proceeding, remember that you can’t cancel a queued withdrawal, so if you initialize it you’ll have to complete it.

Select the vault in which you have invested; the withdrawal interface is immediately available in the vault card (desktop) or appears after selecting "INVEST" (mobile). If all your funds are already used by the vault, “STANDARD” will be highlighted.

Choose the amount to withdraw and confirm the transaction in your wallet.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image12 (4)>)![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image18 (5)>)

As usual, a notification will appear in the topmost part of the screen: your withdrawal is now queued.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image20 (5)" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The following Friday, the vault at 8 am UTC will close the current epoch and proceed with operations to issue a new set of weekly options. After about 11 am UTC (the time is variable because it depends on the dispute time of expired options and new auctions), you can complete your withdrawal.

There is no rush, though: you can complete your withdrawal at any time; there is no deadline.

Also, an important note: the SOL vault is an exception, you only need to start the withdrawal, you won't need to finalize it by following the next steps. After about 11 am UTC, you will automatically receive your SOL in your wallet, in the form of wSOL (wrapped SOL). For all other vaults, proceed as follows.

Entering the webapp you’ll immediately see a reminder.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image9 (3)" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

As you select the relevant vault card, you will notice that the interface is automatically changed and prompts you to complete your withdrawal.

Continue by confirming the transaction in your wallet. In case a withdrawal valued at zero is indicated, worry not and confirm anyway.

You will receive a confirmation notification at the top of the screen as your funds become available again in your wallet.

Once again, please remember that vaults containing staked tokens will only return you staked tokens. So stETH, rETH and sAVAX vaults will give you stETH, rETH and sAVAX, there’s no way to withdraw ETH or AVAX from them.

## (optional) Instant withdrawal on Etherscan <a href="#h.ejzcwg4bex7m" id="h.ejzcwg4bex7m"></a>

You can also proceed to withdraw via Etherscan/Snowtrace. These steps are not possible for vaults on Solana.

Go to the Etherscan/Snowtrace page of the vault in which you deposited (you will find the links in the vault cards) and proceed to check your deposit receipt, following the instructions [here](how-to-deposit.md#h.ejzcwg4bex7m).

After taking note of your receipt, select the "contract" tab, then "write as proxy" and connect your wallet.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image13 (3)>)

Select the function "withdrawInstantly" and write the amount you got as a deposit receipt. Finally, press write and confirm the transaction in your wallet.

## (optional) Standard withdrawal on Etherscan <a href="#h.98p7u0fs35v0" id="h.98p7u0fs35v0"></a>

You can also proceed to withdraw via Etherscan/Snowtrace. These steps are not possible for vaults on Solana.

Go to the Etherscan/Snowtrace page of the vault in which you deposited (you will find the links in the vault cards) and proceed to check your vault shares: scroll down and select the "contract" tab, then "read as proxy"; select the function “shareBalances'' and paste your wallet. Copy the amount shown.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image14 (5)>)![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image2 (2)>)

Now select “Write as proxy” and connect your wallet.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image13 (3)>)![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image5 (7)>)

Call the function “initiateWithdraw” by writing the amount of your shares and selecting “Write”. You have initiated your withdrawal.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image4 (2)>)

After about 11 am UTC on the following Friday, from the same Etherscan page select “Write as proxy” again and call the function “completeWithdraw”.
