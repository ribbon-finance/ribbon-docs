# How to stake, unstake vault shares and claim rewards

In this guide you will find instructions for staking/unstaking your vault shares and claim your rewards in the liquidity mining program currently ongoing. If while following these instructions you encounter any difficulties or errors, we are at your disposal in our [Discord](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://discord.gg/rm7h9ce3ep\&sa=D\&source=editors\&ust=1662913666393691\&usg=AOvVaw2En00A5xtkjoM1h7E1Z8Nj) server Support channel.

Please consider that only vaults on Ethereum mainnet participate in the program.

Staking your vault shares presents no risk in terms of loss in value or decrease in your capital. You can stake and unstake at any time, with no strings attached or penalties. At the same time, you are free to claim your rewards at any time, even after unstaking. Staked vault shares are also freely transferable.

The liquidity mining program is part of Ribbonomics:

* The amount of RBN rewards for each vault is determined every two weeks by a gauge vote on Snapshot. Only veRBN holders are eligible to vote.
* veRBN holders can also increase their rewards up to 2.5x times. For more information, please check [this guide](../../ribbonomics/how-to-lock-rbn-boost-and-claim-protocol-revenues.md).

A notice will appear about using veRBN to get your rewards boost. The meaning of the message is as follows:

* If you first lock your RBN and then stake your vault shares, the boost will automatically be applied to your staking rewards.
* If you first stake your shares and then lock your RBN, you'll have to claim some rewards or select "apply boost" on the governance website to get the boosted staking rewards.

For more information on boosting and veRBN check out [this guide](../../ribbonomics/how-to-lock-rbn-boost-and-claim-protocol-revenues.md).

The page will be automatically updated with the amount of your staked position, and a few seconds later you'll be able see your first rewards accumulating.

The staking transaction will automatically take your receipt token (rToken) from the vault. It will then exchange them into gauge tokens (rrToken), which you will find in your wallet at the end of the transaction. These gauge tokens representing your staked position are freely transferable.

Your vault shares are now unstaked and available again.

Rewards are periodically loaded into the staking contract; it may happen that sometimes they are temporarily depleted and cannot be claimed immediately. They are usually available again in 24/48 hours.
