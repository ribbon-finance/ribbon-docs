# Upgrades

We have the option to make the following changes to the current architecture:

&#x20;1\. adjusting RBN emission rate

2\. unlocking all locked RBN ahead of the max 2 year lock

Given the speed of change in DeFi, being able to change our minds about something as fundamental as the tokenomics model is crucial to remain vigilant, especially in a space as competitive as DOVâ€™s. We think we can maximize tokenholder value this way over having an immutable tokenomics architecture and predictable emission schedule for years to come.
