# Overview and RBN distribution

Ribbon DAO consists of multiple smart contracts. Governor Bravo's standard one token, one vote method is expanded to include a weighting system based on locking RBN for veRBN tokens.

Ribbon DAO has two tokens:

1. &#x20;[RBN](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ribbon-finance)
   * governance voting
2. [veRBN](https://etherscan.io/address/0x19854C9A5fFa8116f48f984bDF946fB9CEa9B5f7) (vote-escrowed RBN)&#x20;
   * governance voting
   * gauge voting
   * boosts $RBN rewards earned on staked vault tokens
   * gauge voting bribe yield in ETH, USDC, RBN
   * boosting bribe yield in ETH, USDC, RBN
   * share of protocol revenue
