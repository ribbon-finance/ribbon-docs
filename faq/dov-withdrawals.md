### Are queued withdrawals subject to profit or loss of the week?

Yes, since you are initiating a withdrawal for vault shares, those shares are subject to either the profits or losses of that week, which will adjust the final withdrawable amount.

### Can I cancel a queued withdrawal?

Unfortunately, you can't cancel a queued withdrawal. You'll have to complete it and reinvest the funds at a later time. [Remember that you can also pause your position](../theta-vault/user-guides/how-to-pause-and-resume.md) instead of withdraw.

Yes, this process will count as two gas transactions.
