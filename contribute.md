## How to Contribute

### Governance

The Ribbon Community uses [RBN tokens](ribbonomics/overview-and-rbn-tokenomics/) to govern the protocol by voting on Ribbon Governance Proposals (RGPs). Anyone can propose a change to the system by starting a discussion in the forum or Discord, however it requires a minimum of 62,500 RBN to create a Snapshot vote. Visit the forum and resources below to learn more.

### Have an Idea?

As a community of "yield hackers", we are always open to new experiments and better ways of doing things. If you have an idea, feel free to use the different channels like [Discord](https://tiny.cc/ribbon-discord) or [GitHub](https://github.com/ribbon-finance).
