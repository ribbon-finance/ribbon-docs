## How to Contribute

### Governance

The Ribbon Community uses RBN tokens to govern the protocol by voting on proposals called Ribbon Governance Proposals (RGPs). Anyone can propose a change to the system by starting a discussion in the forum or Discord, however it requires a minimum of 62,500 RBN to submit a Snapshot vote. Visit the forum and resources below to learn more.
