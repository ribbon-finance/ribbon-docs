# Ribbon Earn stETH

Ribbon Earn stETH uses the 0.5% of deposited funds as well as the yield generated from staking ETH onLido to fund exotic options and enhance the yield earned on stETH. So the vault employs a fully funded [dolphin strategy](what-is-a-dolphin-strategy.md) through which depositors can capitalise on the upside ETH movements while also ensuring their capital is protected up to 99.5% per trade.&#x20;

The name "dolphin" (or "sharkfin") comes from the shape of the vault yield curve, that of a "[dolphin's fin](what-is-a-dolphin-strategy.md)".
