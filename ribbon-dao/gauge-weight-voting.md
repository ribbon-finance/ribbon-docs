# Gauge Weight Voting

## **Voting Rules and Information:**

* Voting will be done via [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/gauge.rbn.eth).
* **veRBN** holders may spread their votes among multiple pools in gauge weight votes.
* **veRBN** holders may receive [bribes](bribes.md).&#x20;
* Gauge weight votes will be **bi-weekly,** starting Fridays at 00:00 UTC and ending on Wednesday 00:00 UTC. The Multisig will then have 2 days to manually update gauge weights accordingly. Please see figure below for the lifecycle of gauge weight vote proposals.
  * Other Ribbon governance votes will be addressed as they arise.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Ribbon Finance multi-sig is still required to sign to establish outcomes of all Ribbon Snapshot votes, for both governance and Ribbon gauge weight votes. In almost all cases, we will vote in-line with RBN / veRBN holders. However, proposals considered to be blatant attacks damaging the protocol will not be signed for.
{% endhint %}
